## Our Sustainability Framework

The United Nations (UN) forecasts that by 2030, world population will have surpassed 8.5 billion, and the threat of climate change, coupled with growing demand for critical resources, will add considerable stress to our societies and the environment. Our future depends on urgent action in all sectors including energy, new business models, innovative technology, and behavioural change. 
 
Our Sustainability Framework sets out three ambitions for the future we want to create and demonstrates our support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Driven and underpinned by our [purpose, vision, and values](/pdfs/sembcorp-mission-and-values.pdf), it directs our approach to integrate sustainability and manage our material environmental, social, and governance issues as part of our business strategy.
