## Graduate Opportunities with Sembcorp Energy UK

We understand that the transition from university to working life can be daunting. To help graduates settle, the first weeks at Sembcorp are always spent with people who have been in the same position, learning about our products, markets and services.

We want you to feel you’re in a great place and experiencing a great start to your career. In return, you’ll be helping to grow a dynamic and fast-moving business with global reach.

Right from the start we'll be helping you develop new skills and knowledge so that you can apply these quickly and begin to see what a real difference you – and the other motivated people around you - can make.

Our philosophy for success is simple – we strive towards the effective management and development of our people and processes – because that’s ultimately what brings value to our customers and our business. So we’re looking for people with the necessary drive and ambition to succeed in this environment. People who recognise that the world doesn’t stand still and that their careers could take them anywhere in the world.

Good ‘people’ skills and process disciplines are what we’re looking for in our graduates and overall management excellence is what we expect you to develop. We want you to become one of our leaders of tomorrow and need you to be as committed as we are in driving our business forward.

Each of our graduate development areas is designed to develop the skills, behaviours, creativity and confidence that will aid your progress to becoming a future business leader through embodiment of our leadership values – see it, believe it, do it, develop it.
