## What is it like to work for Sembcorp Energy UK?

In a word – exciting! The energy industry is constantly evolving, particularly now as the UK is striving to achieve the Net-Zero 2050 target. At Sembcorp Energy UK you’ll be at the heart of the transition towards creating a low carbon and more efficient energy system for future generations.

Sembcorp has been heading in this direction since entering the UK in 2003, initially providing low carbon solutions to industry. Now, as an integrated energy business with flexible, rapid-response generation and storage assets across England and Wales, we actively participate in many of the smart, sustainable markets created by National Grid to ensure the UK gets the energy it needs – exactly when it needs it.

We’re constantly on the lookout for opportunities that will drive our business forward. Our teams have the skills and knowledge to put us at the forefront of the industry and stay ahead of the field.

The physical and mental wellbeing of our employees is really important to us. In an industry where many risks and hazards need to be controlled and managed, safety is our top priority. We encourage every employee to be a guardian of safety compliance and continuously seek to improve our practices.

We have strong employee assistance programmes (EAPs) and support services that help our teams with a range of issues that can impact their work or home life from anxiety and legal issues, to relationships, childcare, and bereavement. Colleagues are also supported by a team of dedicated Mental Health First Aiders who are trained to spot the signs of mental health issues, offer initial help, and guide people towards further support.

Guided by our [global values](https://www.sembcorp.com/en/media/514876/sembcorp-mindsets-and-competency-framework.pdf), we encourage our employees to help shape the positive environment in which we work.
