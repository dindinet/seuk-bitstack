## Embedding Responsible Business Practices

Our strategy to embed responsible business practices within our organisation encompasses corporate governance, ethical business and compliance, and risk management.

We recognise that running our business competently and ethically, complying with all legal and regulatory requirements, and managing risk effectively underpins our ability to deliver sustainable, long-term value and benefits for all our stakeholders: our colleagues, shareholders, customers, and the communities in which we operate.

We ensure that our business is conducted according to rigorous ethical, professional, and legal standards, which includes maintaining robust corporate governance and an [Employee Code of Conduct](/pdfs//sembcorp-employee-code-of-conduct.pdf) for our colleagues.
