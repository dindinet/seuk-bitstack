### Help for communities during the Covid-19 pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on communities throughout the UK and has put particular pressure on the charities and groups that support them. Although we can’t solve all the problems of the communities that surround our sites, we’re determined help.

Our employees play an important role in generating the electricity that keeps the nation powered and our continued operation has meant we’ve been able to give financial support to groups and organisations helping in response to the coronavirus crisis and lockdown.

### These include donations to:

* Trussell Trust – support a network of over 1,200 foodbanks UK-wide (including 25 near Solihull & Birmingham and 5 in Middlesbrough & Redcar).
* Age UK Solihull – provide advice and practical support to older people across the Solihull borough.
* St Basil’s – a youth homelessness charity supporting young people in the West Midlands, helping them to find and keep a home, grow their confidence, and develop skills.
* Redcar & Cleveland Voluntary Development Agency – in aid of a Relief Fund specifically set up to help the local community respond to the coronavirus crisis.
* Ladies of Steel – a community group based in Dormanstown and Redcar focused on getting people together through social activities.
* EVA Women’s Aid – Give support to survivors of domestic abuse Redcar & Cleveland.

Each year Sembcorp Energy UK also makes financial and ‘in-kind’ donations to a wide variety of community causes, such as:

* University Hospitals Birmingham Charity - in support of the 2020 Christmas campaigns at Solihull hospital and other hospitals within the Trust. 

  All Kids First - an initiative that provided hampers over the 2020 Christmas holidays to around 3,000 school children on Teesside who would normally qualify for free school meals.
* Solihull Moors FC, Boldmere St Michaels, and Halas Hawks youth football teams close to our Solihull office.
* Aberavon Green Stars rugby club close to one of our sites in South Wales.
* Zoe’s Place Baby Hospice, First Marske and New Marske Scouts, Backstreet Theatre Group, Grangetown, Kirkleatham Hall School, and Remembering Rebecca close to Wilton International.

## Annual Activities

### Sembcorp Gives Back Week

From Singapore to China, India to Chile, each year Sembcorp employees across the globe take part in activities helping communities where they work.

**2020** – on the theme of ‘Energy for Good’ six of our colleagues took part in a socially
distanced litter pick at Wilton International and ‘virtual volunteers’ in our Solihull
team helped young people supported by St Basils with online interview and CV skills
training.

**2019** – the theme was ‘Zero Waste’ and our UK volunteers braved bitterly cold and
wet conditions to take part in a beach clean-up at Seaton Carew.

### Community Calendar

On behalf of 12 process industry companies on Teesside, Sembcorp Energy UK produces a calendar featuring artwork by primary school children closest to the area’s main industrial sites. Distributed free to around 20,000 households it contains useful site-related safety information about Wilton International. Each year at the calendar’s launch in December, all schools involved receive a donation and all the pupils who take part are given gift tokens to say thank you.  

### Supporting our employees

Whether they have taken part in a fundraising marathon or given their own time to volunteer, we support the charitable efforts of our employees through match funding.

Our last match funding donation of 2020 was in support of an employee who volunteers in his own time to help the Coventry arm of Langar Aid - a community project that aims to feed as many homeless people as possible.
