## Our Commitment to Sustainability

Globally, our purpose and passion is to do good and play our part in shaping a sustainable future, focusing on three sustainability ambitions:

- Enabling a low-carbon and circular economy
- Empowering our people and communities
- Embedding responsible business practices

We recognise that our business activities impact the places and communities in which we operate, both directly and indirectly. We also believe that responsible businesses can play a positive role in society as agents of transformation for a sustainable future. 

Sembcorp Energy UK has a deep commitment to sustainability that encompasses our impact on the environment, our people, and our communities, underpinned by responsible and ethical business practices. We are able to play a significant part in helping the UK to meet its 2050 Net-Zero target with our vision  to be the leading provider of innovative energy services driving the transition to a cleaner world. 

Our Sustainability Framework is closely aligned to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is an essential pillar of our global business strategy – allowing us to deliver long-term value, growth, and benefits for all our stakeholders.
