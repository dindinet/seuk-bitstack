## Empowering our People and Communities

Our strategy to empower our people and communities encompasses prioritising health and safety, assuring employee welfare, and supporting the sustainable development of our communities.

### Health, safety, and the environment 

Managing our health, safety, and environmental (HSE) responsibilities is our first priority. We are committed to continuously improving our HSE performance and managing any risks associated with our activities, products, and services. 

We integrate HSE and environmental considerations into all aspects of our business operations and processes with the aim of preventing accidents, injuries, occupational illnesses or pollution, and conserving natural resources.

Preserving wildlife in all the areas we operate is of great importance to us, including surrounding our 40+ electricity generating sites throughout England and Wales, and at Wilton International on Teesside where we are members of the Industry Nature Conservation Association (INCA). 

### Employee Welfare

We are committed to providing a fair, diverse, and inclusive workplace and believe that all employees and business stakeholders should be treated with dignity and respect. Our five key principles to ensure fair employment practices are to:

* Recruit and select based on merit, skills, experience and ability, regardless of age, race, gender, religion or family status
* Treat employees fairly and with respect and implement progressive human resource management systems
* Provide equal opportunities for training and development based on employees' strengths and needs, to help them achieve their full potential
* Reward fairly based on ability, performance, contribution and experience
* Adhere to UK employment practices and legislation

### Supporting our Communities

Community investment is an integral part of our business culture and our sustainability strategy. 

We contribute to the sustainable development of communities close to our offices and operational sites – working in partnership with our neighbours to invest in initiatives that can have a profound impact on people’s lives. We also support our colleagues’ charitable activities with match funding.

Our Community Investment strategy focuses on five of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and encourages contributions to the sustainable development of our communities.
