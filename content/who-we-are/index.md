### Sembcorp Energy UK

We are a leading integrated energy business, providing flexible energy services and sustainable solutions supporting the UK’s transition to Net Zero.

With a 968MW portfolio of energy generation and battery storage in operation, our expertise helps major energy users and suppliers improve their efficiency, profitability, and sustainability, while supporting the growth of renewables and strengthening the UK’s electricity system.

At Wilton International in Teesside, we supply private wire electricity, world-scale utilities, and specialist services to energy-intensive industrial businesses on the site, providing energy resilience, security, and cost advantages. These services are complemented by our fleet of fast-acting, decentralised power stations and battery storage sites situated throughout England and Wales. Monitored and controlled from our central operations facility in Solihull, these flexible assets deliver electricity to the national grid, helping to balance the UK energy system and ensure reliable power for homes and businesses.

We are an ethical business, playing our part in building a sustainable future and creating long-term value for our communities and stakeholders. We’re actively supporting the nation’s energy transition to Net-Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Our strategy is driven by our purpose, vision and five core values:
