## Apprenticeship Opportunities With Sembcorp Energy UK

Taking your first few steps into a new job can seem daunting, so we have a range of schemes to make the transition from education to a career an easy one. 

All our schemes are designed to support and kick-start your career in a fast-paced working environment at the heart of the energy transition, helping school-leavers through to graduates. 

Designed with flexibility in mind, we aim to offer the right opportunity to candidates that share our [key values](https://www.sembcorp.com/en/media/514876/sembcorp-mindsets-and-competency-framework.pdf) and relish the challenge of being a pioneer in the energy sector.

## Engineering Apprenticeships

We employ a range of top quality engineers in a variety of engineering disciplines and the good news is you don’t necessarily need a degree to find an entry point to the energy sector with us.

We have apprentices across the UK, focused in two different specialisms: Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. All our new apprentices will be studying the Maintenance & Operations Engineering Technician Standard, which is a Level 3 Diploma. We’re making sure the next generation of skilled talent is ready to join the workforce and the qualification will provide the apprentices with an all-round knowledge of:

- the operation and maintenance of appropriate plant and equipment
- relevant industry health and safety standards
- regulations and environmental and regulatory requirements
- maintenance and operational practices
- the relevant engineering theories and principles relative to their role

## IT Apprenticeships

### Cyber Security

Any computer connected to the internet is vulnerable to attacks. So Cyber Security is a big deal to businesses and society. Cyber Security technologists are on the front line of information security – you’ll fight cyber threats – protecting systems and employees from harm.

Using logic, and your creative skills, you’ll keep one step ahead of hackers and cyber criminals. You could work in technical areas like security design, testing, investigations, and response. Or, you could work in risk analysis on cyber operations, risk, governance, and compliance. Either way, you’ll make technology secure and safe.

### Infrastructure Technician

Our Infrastructure Technician Level 3 Apprenticeship combines online learning, classroom training and on-the-job experience to develop real world skills using innovative technology.

This apprenticeship opens up opportunities to develop and enhance digital skills, ensuring people have the grounding needed to become skilled PC professionals, data defenders, or cloud controllers.

### Software Developer

Software Development technicians build simple software applications – they could be web, mobile or desktop. You’ll work in a team, contributing your part to large software development projects.

Part of the job is interpreting simple design requirements – understanding what’s required and how you’re going to create it. Teamwork is key. You’ll work with code that other people in your team have developed to produce your part of the project.

Like to get things working? You’ll also test your component to make sure it does what it’s supposed to do.
