UK, May 12, 2020

As part of leadership succession planning, Sembcorp Industries (Group) has announced today that Andy Koss will succeed Nomi Ahmad as the new Head of its UK subsidiary, Sembcorp Energy UK (SEUK), from August 3, 2020. Mr Ahmad will relocate back to Singapore to take up an executive position within the Group.

Prior to joining SEUK, Mr Koss has held a number of senior roles at the North Yorkshire-based power production company Drax for the past 15 years. These include managing key stewardship responsibilities as Director of Strategy, Head of Investor Relations, Group Treasurer and Head of Risk. In his last role as Chief Executive of Generation, Mr Koss was instrumental in the transformation of Drax into a leading generator and supplier of renewable energy.

With vast experience in driving change in a rapidly evolving UK energy market, Sembcorp is positive that Mr Koss possesses the critical skills and abilities to grow its position as a dynamic and innovative energy player, while enabling the company to play its part in helping to keep the UK’s power supply balanced and resilient in line with the UK’s world-leading low carbon ambitions.

Mr Neil McGregor, Group President & CEO, Sembcorp Industries, said, "I am pleased that Andy has accepted our offer to helm our operations in the UK as we seek to accelerate our business offerings in key low-carbon growth areas. I believe that together with the continued support from our people, local leadership and partners, Andy will be well-positioned to steer the company in the right direction."

Mr Koss said, "I am delighted to be joining Sembcorp Energy UK at this exciting time and look forward to using my experience to accelerate its growth as an integrated energy company. The UK’s steady transition to Net-Zero by 2050 presents many opportunities for us to provide more innovative value through sustainable solutions to our customers and expand our business presence in the market."

Under Mr Ahmad’s leadership, SEUK has successfully positioned itself as a flexible, rapid-response power player with assets at more than 40 sites across the country alongside its key centralised utilities and services for the industry on Teesside. The business now features advanced merchant capability and is ideally positioned to grow further in the energy transition.

Mr Ahmad said, "I will look back at my time in the UK market with huge affection, especially the tremendous people and teams I have had the privilege to work with. I look forward to bringing my accumulated knowledge and experience to help drive the Group’s growth in other energy markets around the world."
