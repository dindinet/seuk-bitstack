Community investment is an integral part of Sembcorp’s business culture and sustainability strategy. We contribute to the sustainable development of communities close to our offices and operational sites around the world – working in partnership with our neighbours to invest in initiatives that can have a profound impact on people’s lives.

Thanks to contributions from generous employees, Sembcorp Energy UK donated a total of £15,000 to support communities close to our offices across Solihull and Teesside during the festive period that saw the ending of a year that has proved so difficult for many people.

£7,500 was donated to the Christmas campaign run by University Hospitals Birmingham Charity (UHBC), that provides hampers of delicious festive food and drink for hard-working NHS staff to enjoy on Christmas Day, Christmas trees to brighten up the hospitals, and toys for young patients across the West Midlands. Solihull Hospital is supported by UHBC and is a neighbour of Sembcorp’s central operations facility in Solihull that monitors and controls over 40 electricity generating sites throughout England and Wales.

Another £7,500 was given to All Kids First – a campaign organised by Middlesbrough gym owner Mike Hind MBE. It provided hampers over the Christmas holidays to around 3,000 primary school children on Teesside who would normally qualify for free school meals.

Sembcorp’s donation was the largest single contribution received by All Kids First. Up until the point that the Government announced additional financial help for communities nationwide, Teesside individuals, businesses, and organisations had pledged a total of almost £27,000. The hampers were distributed from local primary schools in December 2020 and two of our employees took time out to help at Kirkleatham Hall School, just a mile from Sembcorp Energy UK headquarters at Wilton International.

#### **Employees volunteer their gifts to help others**

Sembcorp Energy UK originally pledged £5,000 to each campaign from the business, however our employees were keen to show their personal support too. Many volunteered to donate all or half of the value of a £50 gift voucher they were due to receive as a thank you for their efforts throughout the year and in this way the company was able to give much more.

Andy Koss, Sembcorp CEO UK & Middle East, said: 

> “We’re delighted to support University Hospitals Birmingham Charity’s Christmas campaign, particularly this year, as a way to show our appreciation and say thank you to everyone working hard at Solihull Hospital and other hospitals within the Trust."

Commenting on the All Kids First campaign, he added: 

> “It was a great idea suggested by the employees themselves who were touched by the All Kids First initiative and wanted to give something back to help struggling families around our site.”
>
> “I’m also proud that many of the team at Sembcorp Energy UK volunteered to donate their own gift from the company this year so they could contribute too. They’ve been incredibly generous, and it’s allowed us to increase our donations by 50%! Thank you to everyone.”
