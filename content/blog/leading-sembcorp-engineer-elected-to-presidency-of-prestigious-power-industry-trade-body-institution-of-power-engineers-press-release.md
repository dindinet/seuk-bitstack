#### Historic engineering institution powers up for the future

The Institution of Diesel and Gas Turbine Engineers (IDGTE) has relaunched as the Institution of Power Engineers.

The relaunch reflects the organisation’s commitment to the latest technologies and its vision for the future in the evolving power and prime-mover landscapes.

At its Annual General Meeting attended by senior representatives of industry, Engineering Council, Professional Engineering Institutions, The Royal Academy of Engineering and academia, the 106-year-old organisation formally announced its change of name to the Institution of Power Engineers.

The move reinforces its focus on current and emerging energy and power technologies and its commitment to being the leading specialist institution for power engineers.

The activities of the Institution in recent years have encompassed a great deal more than the old name (IDGTE) would suggest with conferences and seminars on such subjects as security of electricity supply networks, fast response power plant as a back-up to intermittent renewable generation, energy storage technologies, hybrid power systems and microgrids as well as the development of reciprocating engines and gas turbines to meet these needs and to operate on renewable fuel sources.

But it is not all about electrical generation.

The word "Power" is used in its widest sense to include mechanical drive, marine propulsion, rail traction, hybrid drive systems and energy networks. Institution of Power Engineers 7th November 2019

Incoming President, Scott Taylor, above, who took up his position at the AGM, said: "This is an exciting time for the Institution and I am extremely honoured to be the latest President of this esteemed professional engineering institution.

"With the power world looking at the 5Ds – Decarbonisation, Decentralisation, Democratisation, Digitalisation and Deregulation - I am eager to take the Institution forward covering these pillars through our key themes of Reciprocating Engineers, Gas Turbines, Renewable Energy, Storage and Power Systems and our broad range of activities including conferences, technology seminars, our publications, the Power Engineer, and the Annual Operational Report.

The Institution of Power Engineers is industry focused and provides a route to professional registration with Engineering Council at all levels - Chartered Engineer (CEng), Incorporated Engineer (IEng) and Engineering Technician (EngTech) – for suitably qualified and experienced engineers working in the power industries.
