Sembcorp Energy UK is proud to say that, having secured some of the first contracts, two of our 20MW battery sites are now delivering National Grid ESOâ€™s Dynamic Containment service.\
\
This is a new fast frequency response service that reacts quickly to maintain system frequency within safe operating limits and secure electricity supplies.\
\
Keeping the system balanced in this way supports the continued growth of renewables, which can lower system inertia, as the UK transitions to a Net-Zero carbon emissions future.
